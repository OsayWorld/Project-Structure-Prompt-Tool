# Project Structure Tool • Production v9

Production v9 is a desktop-ready successor built from the original production architecture, not a stripped rewrite. It preserves multi-workspace scanning, checkbox include/exclude control, full-project copy, AI prompt workflows, secret scan, token budgeting, editor tools, launch wrappers, and packaging helpers while tightening the UI into one unified desktop shell.
